Project 3: TaskQuest TS
Concept

TaskQuest TS is a personal task tracker built with TypeScript.

It allows users to:

Add tasks with name, priority, and due date

Mark tasks as completed

Filter tasks by priority or completion status

See overdue and upcoming tasks

Why unique:

Most task trackers are in plain JS; using TypeScript adds type safety

Combines priority + due date + completion filters

Lightweight, expandable, and professional
